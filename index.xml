&amp;#34;The Value Line&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Core vs Context&amp;#34; combine to create a thinking framework.
The Value Line Framework The Value Line Framework is divided into two sections: the Core and the Context.</description>

      <description>During covid, we all find ourselves on Zoom and Teams meetings doing presentations.
Using standard Zoom and Teams, you share your slide deck and narrate it as Chris Judd says, &amp;#34;as a disemboded voice.&amp;#34; It isn’t very engaging.
Chris Judd introduce me to OBS - Open Broadcaster Software. OBS really is an amazing piece of software. If you watch youtube or twitch, they are probably using OBS to make their streams.</description>

      <description>While I am not new to blogging, I was re-inspired by Sasi Peri, a coworker, and her new blog. This gave me the itch to share my experiences and information with hope of helping others..
Now that I was re-inspired to blog, I had a fortunate conversation with Drew Heintz. Drew is a bright young man finishing up his Computer Science and Security degrees from RIT. Drew, shared with me that he did his resume using Hugo.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
