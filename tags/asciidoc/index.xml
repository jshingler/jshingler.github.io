      <description>While I am not new to blogging, I was re-inspired by Sasi Peri, a coworker, and her new blog. This gave me the itch to share my experiences and information with hope of helping others.
 Now that I was re-inspired to blog, I had a fortunate conversation with Drew Heintz. Drew is a bright young man finishing up his Computer Science and Security degrees from RIT. Drew, shared with me that he did his resume using Hugo.</description>
